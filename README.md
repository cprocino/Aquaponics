## intro
This project was based around the idea of PID and our task was to build a system using PID to keep one variable in the system constant. We decided to do a aquaponics system with the controlled variable being the water level of the plant tank. Our system would be relatively simple, the entire system would be essentially enclosed inside a large 20 gallon fish tank. The tank would be partially filled with water that would act as a reservoir their would then be a smaller water tank inside that would have its water level controlled via a pump and valve using PID.



## planning 
our planning was rather simple as the construction of our project was largely already made. The below picture is our initial very rough sketch of the basis of our project, it will make much more sense once one views the completed project. The sketch is faithful to our final project with the exception of the monitored tank being suspended instead of laying on some wood on the bottom

our planning was slightly skewed by our knowledge of our lack of knowledge in PID 
for the first week after we desided on our project we would create the skeleton of our project using the fish tank and a few other household and lab idems.
the rest of the time we would spend trying to figure out how we would PID the project and how the new valves and pumps could be controlled with arduinos.
