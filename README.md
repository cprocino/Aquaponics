## intro
This project was based around the idea of PID and our task was to build a system using PID to keep one variable in the system constant. We decided to do a aquaponics system with the controlled variable being the water level of the plant tank. Our system would be relatively simple, the entire system would be essentially enclosed inside a large 20 gallon fish tank. The tank would be partially filled with water that would act as a reservoir their would then be a smaller water tank inside that would have its water level controlled via a pump and valve using PID.
